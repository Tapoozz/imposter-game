# 🎈 imposter-game 🎈

Welcome to **Imposter Game** – a party game of wit, bluffing, and deduction!

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Choose the number of players** (minimum 3).
2. The game randomly selects a secret word and picks one player to be the **Imposter**.
3. All players except the Imposter see the secret word.
4. The Imposter receives a related word as a hint, so they aren't completely in the dark!
5. Each player, in turn, says a word related to the secret word (but not the word itself!).
6. The Imposter tries to blend in and guess the word, while the others try to spot the fake.
7. When ready, everyone votes on who they think the Imposter is.
8. If the group finds the Imposter, they win! If not, the Imposter wins.
